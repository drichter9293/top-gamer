# ⚔️ Top Gamer

Compete against friends and rise in the rankings!

Top Gamer is ranking system that can accomodate any configuration, from simple 1v1 games to free-for-alls and team games.

Rankings start at 1500 for all players. Points are transferred between players after each match, with winning players stealing points from losing players. Upsets result in a larger transfer of points than predicted results.

## Tech Stack

The frontend is built with React and Material-UI, while the backend is an Express server with a PostgreSQL database.

The site is deployed via Heroku. It is currently running on a free dynamo, so it may take some time to open on the initial load. Please be patient!

## Leaderboards

The current Leaderboard is being used to track Monopoly Deal games at athenahealth, but support for new leaderboards is in the works!

## Upcoming Features

- User accounts

- Multiple leaderboards
